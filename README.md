# Quadcopters
Arduino libraries for the quadcopters of the feromone robotics team

This folder should/will contain:

-All code directly involved in maneuvering the drone                   <-- WHAT WE ARE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW!!!
    
    1. The motor controller code(for ESCs)
    
    2. The flight controller(IMU and adjust code) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BoIE8YQwM8(code) <-Video on the IMU code
    
    3. Any sensors whos ouptut contribute to flight adjustment
    
    4. Test/callibration code for making sure the drone is functioning properly

GPS related code for tracking/planning flight

    -More to come on the modules for this

Sensors for measurments the drone needs to take
    
    -More to come, many modules can be used

Code setting up the basic communication between drones
    
    -ESP8266 will be used

Support repositories or repositories that build off of this:

    -Image Processing

    -AI
//Ask me if you need or want into these folders
